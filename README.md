# Data Science App

In this app, I'll be deploying pre-trained NLP, computer vision, dataviz and generative models in a single application on Streamlit. The idea is to leverage pre-trained models and gather use cases and algorithms. It's also a good opportunity for me to become more familiar with all pre-trained models available in the open-source community.
